## JavaScript Alert and Prompt

This repository contains two files, `alertsinjavascript.html` and `alert.js`, that demonstrate the usage of JavaScript's `alert` and `prompt` functions. This README provides an overview of the repository and instructions on how to use and understand the code.

### Repository Contents

- `alertsinjavascript.html`: This HTML file serves as the entry point for the application. It contains a basic structure and includes the JavaScript file.

- `alert.js`: This JavaScript file contains examples of how to use the `alert` and `prompt` functions in JavaScript.

### Alert Function

The `alert` function is used to display a message box with a specified message and an OK button. It is commonly used to provide information or notify users about certain events.

Example:

```javascript
alert("Hello, World!");
```

This example will display a message box with the text "Hello, World!" and an OK button.

### Prompt Function

The `prompt` function is used to display a message box with a specified message and a text input field. It allows users to enter a value and returns the entered value as a string.

Example:

```javascript
let name = prompt("Please enter your name:");
console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
```

This example will display a message box with the text "Please enter your name:" and an input field. The value entered by the user will be stored in the `name` variable and then logged to the console along with a greeting.
